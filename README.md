# week4-data-group
For Arun and Erkan

Quick README on what to do:
- requirements.txt self explanatory, let me know if you need to add anything to it
- script.py is the main meat of what is going on, should've mentioned what to do to the file but from lines 109 to 121
- is where the cleaning/transforming happens, feel free to tweak as you see fit, add more or remove stuff
- would be nice to have a function that handles all the cleaning within the main, which is itself composed of
- smaller functions that do individual tasks i.e. converting stuff to datetimes, etc.
- scrubbing.ipynb is just the notebook I practised the transforming on, nothing too important
- Dockerfile is used to upload to the production schema table: week4_alex_production.production_ecommerce
